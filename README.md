**About me:** <br />
Hello, my name is Vamshi. The following are my projects in Machine Learning and Finance. I have started to learn ML seperate outside of my University study interests. I am really passionate in combining what I learn in economics and finance with Data Science. And the following are the projects starting with Data Science standalone and later finance projects.

# [Project 1: Titanic survival prediction](https://github.com/vamshikodipaka7/Vamshi-portfolio/blob/main/Titanic3.ipynb)

* Supervised Learning
* Dataset contains features of passengers such as:
  * Name
  * Age
  * Sex
  * etc...
* Cleaned data removing features that did not contribute or irrelevant to the survival of passengers.
* Used scikit-learn logistic regression model to predict the survival of passengers in the test group.
* Uploaded to kaggle and scored 77% accuracy.

# [Project 2: Wine Clustering](https://github.com/vamshikodipaka7/Vamshi-portfolio/blob/main/wineclustering.ipynb)

* Unsupervised Learning
* Dataset contains charactersitics of wines produced in 3 different regions in Italy.
* These wines even though produced in the same region have differnent characteristics, and the KMeans clustering algorithm can be used to classify different types.
* For the dataset, MinMax scaling is done in order to get the most optimal cluster points and bring the examples together into a tighter cluster.
* Principal Component Analysis is used to graph/plot and understand the clusters better.
